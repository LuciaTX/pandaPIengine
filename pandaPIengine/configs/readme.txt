The "makePANDApros" folder contains a script that combines the configuration keys necessary for the search and the heuristic. Otherwise, you would create every combination yourself when you e.g. want to add a new search algorithm or heuristic.

Create Configurations
Run the script in the "makePANDApros" folder. The configurations are created and copied to the "full-configs" folder.

Run Configurations
To determine which configurations to use for the next Lab experiments, copy those you want to run to the "active" folder.

Add Heuristic
To add a new heuristic, copy a file containing the configuration for your heuristic to the  "heuristic-configs" folder (contained in the makePANDApros folder) and re-run the script. The "full-configs" folder will then contain.
